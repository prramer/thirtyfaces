thirtyfaces Readme


thirtyfaces generates random numbers to simulate dice rolls and automatically produces passphrases using the Electronic Frontier Foundation's dice-based passphrase generation methodology (https://www.eff.org/dice).  The number of words used in the passphrase is configurable as well as which world list from the EFF to use.  thirtyfaces gets its name from the combined number of sides of the five dice that you would roll to generate one word in your passphrase.
